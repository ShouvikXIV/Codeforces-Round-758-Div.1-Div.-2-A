# Find-Array
Codeforces Round #758 (Div.1 + Div. 2)

Given n, find any array a1,a2,…,an of integers such that all of the following conditions hold:

1≤ai≤10^9 for every i from 1 to n.

a1<a2<…<an
For every i from 2 to n, ai isn't divisible by ai−1
It can be shown that such an array always exists under the constraints of the problem.
